# Regression

This project is my take on a Kaggle competition of House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques. Here is a link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview .

The project involves exploratory data analysis, handling missing data, feature engineering, training machine learning models, ensabling and hyperparameter tuning.
The work resulted in 0.15 Score, evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE).
